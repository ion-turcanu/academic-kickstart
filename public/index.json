Many works are therefore considering edge or fog computing paradigms and Device to Device (D2D) communication using 4G/5G C-V2X or IEEE 802.11p/bd links to obtain content. When content originates (or is maintained) at a central location, however, this requires expensive seeding of the content into the mobile network. We thus advocate basing the decision of when and where to perform fog seeding on a network graph that respects connectivity metrics while performing community detection and exploiting node centrality. We present different seeding strategies and investigate their respective benefits compared to traditional information-centric networking. Using simulations, we demonstrate that choosing a suitable strategy can yield substantial benefits - and vice versa.","tags":[],"title":"Fog Seeding Strategies for Information-Centric Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ion Turcanu","Florian Adamsky","Thomas Engel"],"categories":[],"content":"(to appear)\n","date":1569110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569110400,"objectID":"b8b1d2be36c7c78a68e63ed2a41b3491","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/turcanu2019experimental/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T17:18:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/turcanu2019experimental/","section":"publication","summary":"The main objectives of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) vision is to improve road safety, traffic management, and mobility by enabling cooperative communication among participants.

The traffic management model involves a multi-lane multi-segment highway. Ramp managers regulate admission of vehicles into the highway and their routing to designated lanes. Vehicles moving across each lane are organized into platoons. A Platoon Leader (PL) is elected in each platoon and is used to manage its members and their communications with the infrastructure and with vehicles in other platoons. We develop new methods that are employed to determine the structural formations of platoons and their mobility processes in each lane, aiming to maximize the realized flow rate under vehicular end-to-end delay constraints. We set a limit on the vehicular on-ramp queueing delay and on the (per unit distance) transit time incurred along the highway. We make use of the platoon formations to develop new Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless networking cross-layer schemes that are used to disseminate messages among vehicles traveling within a specified neighborhood. For this purpose, we develop algorithms that configure a hierarchical networking architecture for the autonomous system. Certain platoon leaders are dynamically assigned to act as Backbone Nodes (BNs). The latter are interconnected by communications links to form a Backbone Network (Bnet). Each BN serves as an access point for its Access Network (Anet), which consists of its mobile clients. We study the delay-throughput performance behavior of the network system and determine the optimal setting of its parameters, assuming both TDMA and IEEE 802.11p oriented wireless channel sharing (MAC) schemes. Integrating these traffic management and data networking mechanisms, we demonstrate the performance tradeoffs available to the system designer and manager when aiming to synthesize an autonomous transportation system operation that achieves targeted vehicular flow rates and transit delays while also setting the data communications network system to meet targeted message throughput and delay objectives.","tags":[],"title":"Traffic management and networking for autonomous vehicular highway systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ridha Soua","Ion Turcanu","Florian Adamsky","Detlef Führer","Thomas Engel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1544313600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544313600,"objectID":"9c84b6dfc24eb0e17fdb4943c0f86eeb","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/soua2018multi/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T17:11:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/soua2018multi/","section":"publication","summary":"With the emergence of self-driving technology and the ever-increasing demand of bandwidth-hungry applications, providing the required latency, security and computational capabilities is becoming a challenging task.

In addition, current vehicular architectures are not sufficiently flexible to support the highly heterogeneous landscape of emerging communication technologies, such as mmWave, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), and Visible Light Communication (VLC).

The latter is of paramount importance for automated services, which are supposed to be always-on and always-available. We outline possible solutions for mobility-aware computation offloading, dynamic spectrum sharing, and interference mitigation.

Through a detailed comparative analysis, we show that such a hybrid approach offers superior performance, especially as for offloading the cellular radio access. A lightweight signaling procedure is designed, based on the DSRC VANET, which is able to avoid most of the duplicated data records, even if a distributed operation approach is pursued.

A trade-off arises between the update frequency of the broadcast information and the congestion induced in the wireless shared channel used to send the messages, which is based on the IEEE 802.11p standard in case of a VANET. For periodic updates, the primary metric is the Age-of-Information (AoI), i.e., the age of the latest update received by neighboring nodes.

These applications will share the vehicular network resources with services with very different QoS requirements, such as infotainment services (e.g. live video streams, tourist information).\nDue to the volatility of the vehicular environment, VANETs are characterized by a dynamic topology, short-lived intermittent wireless connectivity, and a cooperative and decentralized communication paradigm. All these features make the provision of high levels of QoS in VANETs a challenging task. Even more challenging is the support of a very diverse set of QoS requirements, due to the high heterogeneity of existing and prospective vehicular applications. The main existing approaches to QoS provisioning in VANETs either tackle this issue by focusing on a single layer of the network architecture, or focus on enabling a single specific QoS class of service. The CONTACT project aims at enabling Quality of Service (QoS) support in VANETs by taking a multi-pronged, cross-layer approach, by developing a set of communication techniques, which efficiently adapt, at the same time to the highly volatile and unstable vehicular environment, to content attributes and properties, and to application performance requirements. For this purpose, CONTACT will investigate the use of three different emerging approaches: Content-Centric Networking (CCN), Software Defined Networking (SDN), and Floating Content (FC). CCN implies introducing (content) name-based addressing instead of host-based addressing. This can be beneficial for communications in highly mobile network scenarios such as vehicular networks, where host addresses are not very meaningful. SDN, with its centralized view of network resources, may help in handling efficiently dynamic (re)allocation of resources/channels, and distribution of content (e.g., by reducing amount of Geobroadcast messages). Finally, FC techniques could be used to improve content availability for delay tolerant communications. The main idea behind CONTACT is to combine and exploit the advantages offered by CCN, SDN and FC, to offer a variety of QoS levels. The improvements in communication reliability, content availability, and end-to-end delay are pursued by adopting strategies based on the type of content (alerts, driving coordination, informational) as well as on its context attributes (such as location of origin, geographical range of interest, time of validity).\nProject duration: 01.04.2016 - 31.03.2020  ","date":1459468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459468800,"objectID":"98aa4121536374a19ab32e79f488e911","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/contact/","publishdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/contact/","section":"project","summary":"Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have been receiving a lot of interest from academia, automotive industry, and government, as they hold the potential to enable a wide range of applications and services, improving both safety and comfort on the road. One of the main drivers of vehicular communications is the support for safety applications (e.g. accident, traffic jam notifications), which together with the more recent autonomous and coordinated driving applications require low end-to-end delay and no packet loss. These applications will share the vehicular network resources with services with very different QoS requirements, such as infotainment services (e.g. live video streams, tourist information). Due to the volatility of the vehicular environment, VANETs are characterized by a dynamic topology, short-lived intermittent wireless connectivity, and a cooperative and decentralized communication paradigm. All these features make the provision of high levels of QoS in VANETs a challenging task. Even more challenging is the support of a very diverse set of QoS requirements, due to the high heterogeneity of existing and prospective vehicular applications. The main existing approaches to QoS provisioning in VANETs either tackle this issue by focusing on a single layer of the network architecture, or focus on enabling a single specific QoS class of service. The CONTACT project aims at enabling Quality of Service (QoS) support in VANETs by taking a multi-pronged, cross-layer approach, by developing a set of communication techniques, which efficiently adapt, at the same time to the highly volatile and unstable vehicular environment, to content attributes and properties, and to application performance requirements. For this purpose, CONTACT will investigate the use of three different emerging approaches: Content-Centric Networking (CCN), Software Defined Networking (SDN), and Floating Content (FC). CCN implies introducing (content) name-based addressing instead of host-based addressing. This can be  beneficial for communications in highly mobile network scenarios such as vehicular networks, where host addresses are not very meaningful.  SDN, with its centralized view of network resources, may help in handling efficiently dynamic (re)allocation of resources/channels, and distribution of content (e.g., by reducing amount of Geobroadcast messages). Finally, FC techniques could be used to improve content availability for delay tolerant communications. The main idea behind CONTACT is to combine and exploit the advantages offered by CCN, SDN and FC, to offer a variety of QoS levels. The improvements in communication reliability, content availability, and end-to-end delay are pursued by adopting strategies based on the type of content (alerts, driving coordination, informational) as well as on its context attributes (such as location of origin, geographical range of interest, time of validity).","tags":[],"title":"CONTACT","type":"project"},{"authors":["Pierpaolo Salvo","Ion Turcanu","Francesca Cuomo","Andrea Baiocchi","Izhak Rubin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1453248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1453248000,"objectID":"12c6c38ed91be1f66002d73fe57499ce","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/salvo2016lte/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T16:02:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/salvo2016lte/","section":"publication","summary":"Floating Car Data (FCD) applications are based on the collection of geo-localized information updates that are issued by vehicles roaming in a given area. These data are an essential source for traffic information and are widely employed by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). We present and examine a hybrid networking architecture and protocol that are used for the efficient execution of such a collection process. We employ a VANET-based multihop dissemination logic to spread control messages and elect designated nodes. Those nodes are exploited to report vehicular data via LTE communications. The performance behavior of the proposed protocol is evaluated through the consideration of two real urban scenarios. In comparing with performance bounds that characterize the performance behavior attained by state-of-theart hybrid integrated VANET and LTE mechanisms, we show our approach to offer a substantial reduction in the traffic load rates induced over the LTE cellular radio access system.","tags":[],"title":"LTE floating car data application off-loading via VANET driven clustering formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ion Turcanu","Pierpaolo Salvo","Andrea Baiocchi","Francesca Cuomo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1446422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446422400,"objectID":"f3a1d3d343ee96ca848ddf32d52cd546","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/turcanu2015discover/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T11:41:42+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/turcanu2015discover/","section":"publication","summary":"Message dissemination and data collection from vehicles are two key enablers of Intelligent Transportation System services that can be offered by a Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) technology. In this work we propose a fully distributed protocol for dissemination of query and collection of reply messages carrying information gathered from vehicles moving in a given target area, in an urban scenario. The key idea is to use the dissemination phase (forward wave) to create a network of relay nodes that are in charge of delivering reply messages back to the originating point (reverse wave). The proposed protocol is evaluated with reference to two real urban environments. Main parameters are dimensioned and an insight in the protocol working is given.","tags":[],"title":"DISCOVER: A Unified Protocol for Data Dissemination and Collection in VANETs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"F-Interop will develop and provide remotely accessible tools to support and accelerate standardization processes and products developments, by offsetting several cost and time barriers.
