title: "Floating Car Data Collection for Intelligent Transportation Systems (FCD4ITS)"
summary: "The FCD4ITS (Floating Car Data Collection for Intelligent Transportation Systems) project will deploy and execute a set of experiments using the RAWFIE vehicular testbeds to evaluate the performance of our own (and other state-of-the-art) Floating Car Data collection algorithms, in order to understand their properties in real-world settings.
We will deploy automated large-scale real-world procedures using Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) provided by the RAWFIE testbeds to evaluate the performance and applicability of our novel algorithms and compare them to the state of the art. RAWFIE testbeds will allow validation of the solutions in real-world settings, building on our existing simulation-based evaluations. We will also give feedback to RAWFIE on facilitating the automated execution of such experiments. Our work will help the research community to understand the limitations of simulations in targeted scenarios and adapt them to better reflect the real world. Our solid experience in fundamental and applied vehicular research will allow us to successfully complete these tasks."
